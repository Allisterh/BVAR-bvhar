## Eigen and boost setting

`bvhar` C++ sources uses

- [`Eigen`](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) library: for matrix computation
- [`boost`](https://www.boost.org) library: for random generation.

If you use `conda`, you can avoid manual setting of these libraries.
Check `requirements/environment.yml` in our repo.
Since conda provides [`eigen`](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/eigen) and [`boost-cpp`](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/boost-cpp), you can easily install them.

Otherwise, you should set their paths by yourself; at this stage.

- `EIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR`: Eigen path that includes the eigen headers
- `BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR`: boost path that includes the boost headers
