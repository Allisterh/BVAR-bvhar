## Eigen and boost setting

`bvhar` C++ sources uses

- [`Eigen`](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) library: for matrix computation
- [`boost`](https://www.boost.org) library: for random generation.

If you use `conda`, you can avoid manual installation using `requirements/environment.yml` in our repo. Since conda provides [`eigen`](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/eigen) and [`boost-cpp`](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/boost-cpp), you can easily install the package with conda environment:

```bash
git clone -b feature/python https://github.com/ygeunkim/bvhar.git
cd python
conda env create -f requirements/environment.yml
conda activate bvhar-env
pip install -e .
```

Otherwise, you should set their paths by yourself; at this stage.

- `EIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR`: Eigen path that includes the eigen headers
- `BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR`: boost path that includes the boost headers

## Installation (development version)

In `python` directory:

```bash
git clone -b feature/python https://github.com/ygeunkim/bvhar.git
cd python
# conda or system install for eigen and boost
pip install -e .
```

## Usage
