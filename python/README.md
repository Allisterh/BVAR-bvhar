## Installation

### Eigen and boost usage

`bvhar` uses Eigen and boost headers in C++ sources. If you use `eigen`
and `boost-cpp` in conda with the conda environment, you donâ€™t have to
take care of them.

``` bash
conda env create -f requirements/environment.yml
conda activate bvhar-env
```

Otherwise, you should set their paths by yourself; at this stage.

- `EIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR`: Eigen path that includes the eigen headers
- `BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR`: boost path that includes the boost headers

### Developement version

In this `python` directory:

``` bash
git clone -b feature/python https://github.com/ygeunkim/bvhar.git
cd python
# use conda script abvoe if you use conda
pip install -e .
```
